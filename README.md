# Maya-Beginner-Testing
My first learning repository 2021-04-13

This is the beginning of my learning in Python scripting for maya and the first time I've used Python in closer to 5 years. With this I begin by testing scripting simple commands and will work my way up to autorigger systems and basic UI's for my own suite of rigging tools in Maya.
